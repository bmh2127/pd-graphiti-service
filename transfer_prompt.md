# Transfer Prompt: Knowledge Graph Pipeline Completion & Operations

## üéØ Project Context & Current Status

You are continuing work on a **Parkinson's Disease Target Discovery Pipeline** that has achieved exceptional success in multi-omics data integration and episode generation. The project has successfully built a comprehensive **5-evidence-type pipeline** that integrates GWAS, eQTL, literature, pathway, and multi-evidence data to identify and prioritize therapeutic targets.

## üèÜ Major Achievements Completed

- **Complete Dagster pipeline** with 5 evidence types (GWAS, eQTL, literature, pathways, integration)
- **14 validated target genes** with comprehensive evidence profiles
- **Sophisticated scoring methodology** with enhanced integrated scores
- **Knowledge graph schema** with complete templates, validation, and episode generation

### **Outstanding Results Achieved**

- **#2 HLA-DRA** (166.0) - neuroinflammation target  
- **#3 LRRK2** (156.6) - established PD drug target
- **#4 RIT2** (128.1) - emerging PD gene
- **#5 BCKDK** (110.8) - novel target with 4 evidence types

### **Knowledge Graph Episode Generation (100% Complete)**
- **81 validated episodes** ready for Graphiti ingestion
- **Perfect data integrity** - 0 cross-reference errors, 0 orphaned episodes
- **Complete evidence coverage** - All 14 genes have 5-6 episode types each
- **High data quality** - 0.685 completeness score across all episodes
- **Graphiti-compatible format** - All episodes pass validation

## üöß Critical Gap: Incomplete Pipeline Automation

### **Current Pipeline Limitation**
The pipeline currently **ends at episode generation** rather than completing the full workflow:

```
Raw Data ‚Üí Multi-Evidence Integration ‚Üí Episode Generation ‚Üí [STOPS HERE]
```

### **Required Complete Pipeline**
```
Raw Data ‚Üí Multi-Evidence Integration ‚Üí Episode Generation ‚Üí Graphiti Ingestion ‚Üí Knowledge Graph ‚Üí Query-Ready
```

### **4. Pipeline Results Context**
- **Latest pipeline execution logs** - Especially the `graphiti_ready_episodes` metadata showing:
  - 81 episodes ready for ingestion
  - Perfect data integrity (0 errors)
  - Episode type distribution
  - Data quality scores (0.685 completeness)

**Most Critical Files for Immediate Implementation:**
1. **`assets.py`** - Shows the current knowledge graph asset structure
2. **`episode_generators.py`** - Contains all the episode creation logic
3. **`definitions.py`** - Shows complete pipeline structure and dependencies
4. **`test_episode_generators.py`** - Demonstrates working episode generation with examples

**Reference Context:**
The agent should understand that `pd_research.graphiti_ready_episodes` contains 81 validated episodes with this structure:
- `episode_name`: Graphiti episode name (e.g., "Gene_Profile_SNCA")
- `episode_data`: Complete episode dictionary with `episode_body`, `source`, etc.
- `validation_status`: All episodes have "success" status
- `episode_type`: One of 6 types (gene_profile, gwas_evidence, eqtl_evidence, literature_evidence, pathway_evidence, integration)
- `gene_symbol`: Target gene (SNCA, LRRK2, HLA-DRA, etc.)

## üéØ Primary Objective: Complete Pipeline Automation

**Mission**: Implement the missing **knowledge graph ingestion asset** to complete the end-to-end automation from raw genomics data to a fully queryable knowledge graph.

### **Required Implementation: `knowledge_graph_ingestion` Asset**

**Purpose**: Final Dagster asset that takes validated episodes and creates the actual knowledge graph in Graphiti MCP.

**Core Requirements**:
1. **Automated Graphiti MCP Integration** - Ingest 81 episodes using exposed Graphiti MCP
2. **Proper Ingestion Ordering** - Follow recommended sequence: gene_profile ‚Üí gwas ‚Üí eqtl ‚Üí literature ‚Üí pathway ‚Üí integration
3. **Robust Error Handling** - Graceful failure management with retry logic and episode-level error tracking
4. **Validation & Testing** - Verify successful ingestion with basic graph queries
5. **Comprehensive Metadata** - Track ingestion success rates, graph statistics, query readiness
6. **Incremental Updates** - Handle pipeline re-runs without duplicate episodes

## üìä Available Data & Resources

### **Ready for Ingestion**
- **Episodes Location**: `pd_research.graphiti_ready_episodes` table
- **Episode Count**: 81 validated episodes across 6 types
- **Data Quality**: 0.685 completeness, 100% validation success

## üîß Technical Implementation Requirements

### **Graphiti MCP Integration Pattern**
```python
# Each episode requires this MCP call pattern:
graphiti_mcp.add_memory(
    name=episode['episode_name'],
    episode_body=episode['episode_data']['episode_body'],
    source=episode['episode_data']['source'],
    source_description=episode['episode_data']['source_description'],
    group_id="pd_target_discovery"
)
```

### **Required Asset Implementation**
```python
@asset(
    deps=["graphiti_ready_episodes"],
    description="Ingest validated episodes into Graphiti knowledge graph"
)
def knowledge_graph_ingestion(
    context: AssetExecutionContext,
    graphiti_ready_episodes: pd.DataFrame
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Implementation needed
```
